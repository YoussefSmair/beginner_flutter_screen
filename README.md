This project is a hands-on Flutter experiment to create a visually engaging welcome screen. The screen combines AppBar navigation elements, rows of styled text and icons, and a prominent circular button to explore user interactions. Designed as a learning exercise, it highlights layout structures, spacing, and color usage, offering beginners a clear example of arranging Flutter widgets and experimenting with basic UI elements.
